Here you will see my first python project  
I named it rainbify.py  
It is a function that takes any string and turns it into a rainbow colored string.  
When learning python I got really drawn by adding color to code, and I thought to myself:  
hmm I wonder if I can make a function that turns anything you write, however long, into a rainbow.  
So I did. Here it is.
